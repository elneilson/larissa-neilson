I am a master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, and I am specializing in Economics and Politics of the Environment. I am currently working as a research assistant under Dr. Anastasia Quintana, aiding her postdoctoral research at the intersection of small-scale fisheries, conservation, and collective action.
