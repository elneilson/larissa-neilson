I am a first-year master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, and I am pursuing a specialization in Energy & Climate. Currently, I am working as a research assistant under Dr. Anastasia Quintana, aiding her postdoctoral research at the intersection of small-scale fisheries, conservation, and collective action.
