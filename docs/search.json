During my undergraduate education at Cal State Monterey Bay, I was part of NSF’s Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program where I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Steve Litvin & Dr. Jim Barry at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) documenting the effects of future climate change on abalone. I also volunteered with Return of the Natives (RON), aiding with environmental education outreach program for 4th-5th grade elementary classes. I am also a huge animal lover and greatly enjoy being outdoors and in the field. I used to volunteer at the UCSC Fort Ord National Reserve monitoring coastal horned lizard populations to inform the dissertation of Ph.D candidate, Danielle Davis. I currently reside in Goleta, CA with my pet rabbit and partner. As I work on my MESM degree, I am working as a research assistant for Dr. Anastasia Quintana, helping with her postdoctoral research on MPA compliance in small-scale fisheries.\nInterests\nI love being outdoors and exploring national parks and monuments. I have a particular affinity for surveying and exploring herptile communities (lizards, snakes, amphibians). My favorite undergraduate classes were the ones where I had the opportunity to interact with native California wildlife and learn about their ecology and relevant conservation efforts Aside from that, I am highly passionate about environmental justice issues and I am an avid supporter of black & indigenous rights groups.\n\n\n\n",
