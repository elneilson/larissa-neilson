      "contents": "\nI am originally from Lima, Peru, but largely grew up in Los Angeles. During my undergraduate education at California State University, Monterey Bay, I was part of the National Science Foundation’s Research Experience for Undergraduates program. I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Steve Litvin & Dr. Jim Barry at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) documenting the effects of current and future climate change on abalone. I presented the results of my research at conferences such as SACNAS and the Wildlife Society’s Annual Symposium in 2018. I also volunteered with the non-profit organization Return of the Natives, where I was a part of an environmental education program for children and assisted with community planting events aiming restore native dune flora to the Monterey coast. Now, I am working as a research assistant for Dr. Anastasia Quintana, helping with her postdoctoral research on compliance in small-scale fisheries.\nWorking in the benthic ecology lab. Image: Todd WalshI love being outdoors and exploring local trails with a particular affinity for surveying herptile communities (lizards, snakes, amphibians). My favorite undergraduate field days were the ones where I could interact with native California wildlife and learn about their ecology and relevant conservation efforts. You can always find me in the field looking for cool snakes and lizards! I previously volunteered at the UCSC Fort Ord National Reserve monitoring coastal horned lizard populations to inform the dissertation of Ph.D candidate, Danielle Davis.\nHanging out with a Monterey ensatinaAside from that, I am highly passionate about environmental justice issues and I am an avid supporter of black & indigenous rights. I hope to apply my data analysis skills to serve underprivileged groups.\nI currently reside in Goleta, CA (Chumash land) with my pet bunny and partner.\nMy pet bunny\n\n\n",
